"""This repo's run policy: which suites run when, decided once.

    gentar/plan.py plan     # what should THIS CI event run?  (the kit's plan job)
    gentar/plan.py lint     # bench-free adaptation checks    (part of run.sh --check)
    gentar/plan.py route    # [secrets] route, one name a line (run.sh maps the slots)

The policy is declared in gentar/policy.toml at adaptation (AGENTS.md,
decision 5) and read here, and only here. The workflow does what `plan`
prints; it holds no tag-parsing or PR-narrowing logic of its own, because
logic in YAML cannot be tested and this can.

`plan` needs no engine, no Docker, no bench and no secrets, so the kit runs
it on a GitHub-hosted runner (or the one GENTAR_CI_RUNNER names, never the
bench's) BEFORE any job may touch the self-hosted bench runner:
a pull request's code never reaches the bench-host unless this says so.

Phases (the pilot's words: phase 1 for every PR, phase 2 only when asked):

  phase 1   every PR and every push to the default branch
              checks   bench-free, on a GitHub-hosted runner (run.sh --check)
              bench    [phase1].floor, plus on a PR the suites its body
                       declares in a `gentar: a b` line when bench = "declared"
  phase 2   the full regression (run.sh --sweep), only on the triggers
            [phase2].on names: dispatch, the `arena` tag, `v*-rc*` tags.
            Its job is named `arena / phase2`; release-gate.sh looks for it.
  targeted  an `arena-<suite>` tag or a dispatch naming suites: exactly
            those suites. Never counts as phase 2.
  release   a `v*` tag runs nothing here. A release is GATED on a green
            phase 2 of its commit (release-gate.sh), not tested after it.

With [arena] bench = "mirror" (a PUBLIC repository), nothing here reaches a
bench: phase 2 runs in a private mirror repository that pulls this one
(subject-template/mirror/), and its result comes back as the commit status
`arena/phase2`, which release-gate.sh reads ([phase2] evidence = "status").

Without a policy.toml, `plan` reproduces the 0.3.x kit's behaviour, so an
engine bump alone changes nothing an adopter did not choose.

Output: KEY=value lines on stdout, and the same appended to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
when it is set. Exit 0 with a plan; exit 2 for a policy or input that is
wrong (unknown key, unknown suite, a bad name) -- a refusal, never a guess.
